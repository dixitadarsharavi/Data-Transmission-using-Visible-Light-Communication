# Data-Transmission-using-Visible-Light-Communication
In this project i have designed Visible light communication (VLC) module which can provide high information transmission, using light from LEDs as the information carrier. 
In these systems, light emitting diodes blink when information is transmitted through them, a sensitive photovoltaic-cell can detect the on-off behavior and decode the information embedded within it.

##Components Used
Transmitter:  Arduino (Uno)
Receiver:  Arduino (Uno)
LEDs
Photovoltaic Cell
2N2222A NPN switching transistor
Resistors (510 ohm, 10 ohm)
